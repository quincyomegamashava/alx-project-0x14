## Error Handling
TMDb uses standard HTTP status codes and returns error details in JSON. Common responses include:

401 Unauthorized – Missing or invalid API key.

404 Not Found – Requested resource doesn't exist.

429 Too Many Requests – Rate limit exceeded.

Potential 5xx responses for server-side errors.
Use try/catch, check status codes, and provide user-friendly error states.

## Usage Limits and Best Practices
The TMDb API enforces rate limiting—be mindful of frequent requests.

Implement client-side caching for repeated queries like search or movie details.

Use pagination to limit data loads on both client and server side.

Leverage responsive loading states and clear error messages for better UX.

Respect TMDb usage policies (e.g., image attribution for non-commercial use).
